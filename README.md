## My Process

I built this app using React, styled components, yup, formik and other JS libraries. It was fun to play around with state management and I learnt a thing or two when building this project. This was an advanced challenge on Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ) as it contains 'many challenges along the way to completion'. I am happy I completed it in accordance with what's being asked. On to the next!
